# @media-exo2

Let's do another one :

    In a new project (index.html and styles.css)
    Create a container to center the content in the page
    Inside of it, create a flex container and inside 6 divs.
    Give each div a width of 100% (it will take the maximum available space) and a height of 100px
    Give each div a different background color.
    Look at it in a laptop view (1440)
    In the inspector, play with the responsiveness.
    Look how small they get in a mobile size !!!!
    Let's stack them ! Use a media query to give the flex container a column direction on mobile and row direction on a bigger scree.
    TIP : Even tough we can use max-width in the media query, the highly recommended worflow is mobile-first ! So declare your css for mobile and then with media query use min-width.
